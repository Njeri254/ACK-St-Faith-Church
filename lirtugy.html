            <p class="center">Blessed be the Lord God of Israel: for He has come to His people and set them free. He has raised up for us a mighty Saviour: born of the house of His servant David. Through His Holy Prophets He promised of old: that He would save us from our enemies, from the hands of all that hate us. He promised to show mercy to our fathers: and to remember His Holy Covenant. This was the oath He swore to our father Abraham: to set us free from the hands of our enemies, free to worship Him without fear: holy and righteous in His sight all the days of our life. You my child shall be called the prophet of the Most High: for you will go before the Lord to prepare His way, to give His people knowledge of salvation by the forgiveness of all their sins. In the tender compassion of our God: the dawn from on high shall break upon us, to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death: and to guide our feet into the way of peace. Glory to the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit; as it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be. Amen.</p>

            <p class="center">You are the image of the invisible God, the first born over all creation. By you, O Christ, were all things created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible. Thrones and dominions, powers and principalities: were created through you and for you. You are before everything and in you all things hold together. You are the head of your body, the Church, you are the beginning, the first born from the dead, that over everything you may be supreme. Glory to the Father, to the Son and the Holy Spirit; as it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be. Amen.</p>
